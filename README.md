**Extract frames from video file**

This code extracts frames (.jpg) from movie files (.mp4) at a defined framerate. It assumes that each video file is stored in separate subdirectory, and it visualizes a random frame at the end. It assumes following folder structure: root/Scene1/*.mp4, root/Scene2/*.mp4 etc.
